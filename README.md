Free viking game featuring the tough last viking in zero gravity jumping from the flat earth including space dragons, asteroid shooter and naturally brave vikings! The goal is to get to the outer worlds but will our brave viking ever get there?

Tough Viking - FREE Viking Game in zero gravity is a free viking game and space shooter where you  jump and fly from the flat earth into space towards the outer worlds where you hopefully wont be the last viking. Test your skills in this viking saga by fighting a dragon swarm during an asteroid shower. 

In this free android viking game you must combine precise flying between the asteroids with jumping and shooting space dragons while traveling from the flat earth to the outer worlds in order to survive. Also this last tough viking must fight space dragons in zero gravity which is why there are a lot of guns to choose from. In order to make it a real joyride and get these tough guns you must collect space loot in the form of gold coins. 

You wonder how this all make sense? Well... once upon a time the last brave vikings lived who loved guns, the earth became flat and got named "the flat earth" and the dragons attacked within an asteroid shower. In order to survive the tough vikings from Minnesota had to collect gold coin after gold coin because upgraded new guns are not cheap in this alternate galaxy. The outer worlds (to which our tough viking is trying to go) is the goal of this viking saga since her our hero hopefully wont be the last of his kind. The end.
